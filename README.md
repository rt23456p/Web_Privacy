## How to be keep you data safe in every ways?


You need a VPS(Preferably AliCloud/Huawei Cloud as they have no relations in anyways with American Agencies)
A Computer(Mac/Windows/Linux all works)

1. Bulid a SSR-VPN yourself with a safe VPS(Huawei Cloud,Alicloud is good but slightly more expensive)+doub.io script installation guide, ([here for the backup portal](https://github.com/ToyoDAdoubiBackup/doubi)) remember not to install Google BBR algorithm as this may put you in some risks
2. Save the key and use a SSR software such as ShadowsocksR
3. Use Linux to browse the Internet(any is fine, but I like Deepin the most)
