## How to be keep you data safe in every ways?

You need a VPS(Preferably Huawei Cloud as they they surely have no relations in anyways with Any Agencies)
A Computer(Mac/Windows/Linux all works)

1. A solution would be to Bulid a SSR-VPN yourself with a safe VPS(Huawei Cloud,Alicloud is good but slightly more expensive)+doub.io script installation guide, ([here for the backup portal](https://github.com/ToyoDAdoubiBackup/doubi)) remember not to install Google BBR algorithm as this may put you in some risks
2. Save the key and use a SSR software such as ShadowsocksR
3. Use Linux to browse the Internet(any should work fine, but I like Deepin the most)

###You can also try other type of connections to a remote server such as V2Ray etc...###
